# Noise around us
Are birds louder these days? Turns out so many people noticed this, that it started to reflect in web search trends.

{% include birds_are_louder.html %}

One possible explanation is the lower overall noise level in cities and beyond (see also: [The Quiet Planet](https://covid19.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/covid-challenges/quiet-planet) challenge.) We asked ourselves:

> Would a similar thing also happen under the sea?

# Noise pollution in the time of pandemic
Noise pollution has been a growing concern among marine biologists. Increase in maritime traffic for both leisure and fishing purposes, military activity, offshore drilling are just a few examples of sources of unwanted sounds affecting some marine mammals, which depend on mechanisms like echolocation. Our understanding of the complex relation between our loud activities and ocean life is yet to be expanded. However, the present times posed a unique opportunity to research an acute drop in human racket.
As part of safety precautions during the COVID-19 pandemic, many coastal areas declared suspension of all non-essential maritime traffic. This has had a number of effects: the diminished number of traveling vessels leads to reduced noise pollution, decreases water turbidity as seen in Venice, but also limits the capability of marine biologists to perform measurement activities. Is the data out there ready to prove the link?

# Digital recognition of marine mammals

# Conclusions
- The pandemic impacts also the marine life, in multiple ways
- The reduced capacity of performing manual data gathering activities during pandemic restrictions can be offset by automation efforts, with the help of AI and remote sensing
- Aerial photography can be successfully used to detect cetaceans on ocean surface

# Into the future
This is just a small glimpse of the possible areas for investigation. If the data from February to May 2020 could be obtained from regular hydrophone measurements and GPS trackers of cetacean specimen, more knowledge could be inferred about the response of the aquatic life to the sudden change in human activity. Combining with even more sources, like data from the WhaleWatch project, may yield even more interesting results.
